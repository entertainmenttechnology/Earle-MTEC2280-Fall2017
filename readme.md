## About

This course is an introduction to interactive technology with a focus on how we use technology to express ourselves and interact with our environment. This class combines a hands-on exploration of basic components of media, audio, and control circuits. Students also develop interfacing technologies from simple switches to multidimensional sensors, integrated circuits, and micro-controllers. Emphasis will also be placed on communicating between physical and digital systems.
