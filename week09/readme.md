## Homework due Thurs
+ Take a look at [this list](http://graysonearle.com/edu/physcom/relevant-projects-artists/) and find three artists with work you enjoy. Write 2-3 sentences for each project, describing why you like it in a general sense, and what sorts of things you would need to learn to create a similar project.
+ Upload this to your GitHub repo!!
